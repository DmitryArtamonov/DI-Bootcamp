# Exercise 1 : Built-In Functions
# Instructions
# Python has many built-in functions.
# If you feel that you donâ€™t know how to properly implement them take a look at the python documentation online.
#
# Write a program which prints the results of the following python built-in functions: abs(), int(), input().
# Using the __doc__ dunder method create your own documentation which explains the execution of your code. Take a look at the doc method on google for help.

def my_func():
    '''
    Get a string. Print a string. If string is a number, print int and absolute of the number
    :return: None
    '''

    text = input()
    print (text)
    if text.replace('.','').replace('-','').isalnum():
        x = float(text)
        print(int(x))
        print(abs(int(x)))

# print(my_func.__doc__)
# my_func()
